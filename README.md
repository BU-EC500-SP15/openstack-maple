# openstack-maple
Programmable OpenStack Network Services in Maple

Mentor: Andreas Voellmy

Team Members: Cody Doucette, Yao Xiao, Guanchen Zhang, Shigang Zhu

## Vision and Goals Of The Project
The goals of this project are to:
 * collaborate with a team at Cisco Systems and Yale University to bring the Maple programming abstraction to the ODL controller platform.
 * port a significant network application, namely an implementation of the OpenStack Neutron network service onto the Maple service in ODL.
 * evaluate various aspects of the resulting system.
 * explore novel network services enabled by integrating this programming abstraction into an OpenStack system.

## Users/Personas Of The Project
The users of the project would initially be network researchers exploring ways making the network control plane simpler using tools like OpenStack, ODL, and Maple. Eventually, if this project were deployed (in campus networks, perhaps), the users would be network administrators so that they may exercise more fine-grained control over traffic flows with respect to performance and policy.

## Scope and Features Of The Project
This project will port the Maple programming abstraction to the ODL controller platform and will port an implementation of hte OpenStack Neutron network service onto that service.

## Solution Concept
This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:
This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

Design Implications and Discussion:
This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## Acceptance Criteria
This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## Release Planning
Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.
