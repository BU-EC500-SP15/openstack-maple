The objective of out project is that the Maple, as a high-level programming abstraction, will help allow modular programming on applications in SDN, which solves the key bottleneck of ODL. And our goal on this project is to port some certain components of Maple in Java to ODL, including the trace tree and flow tables. A further goal may be to use ODL’s MD-SAL API to access to and store Maple’s state.
