I added some content to the Solution Concept section about the design
implications of the project, including a very basic perspective on why
certain classes are needed and why Java is a good fit for this implementation
based on my understanding so far. I also added some content to the
Users/Personas of the Project to provide some motivation for why this is
important work.

I also have a few comments about the proposal itself:

 * There will be a considerable learning curve at the beginning of the
   project, as we need to first understand the ODL codebase that we'll
   be working with and understand Maple before we start writing code. I
   think it may be reasonable to extend the first release by one week,
   but would hesitate to change anything besides that, since I know that
   there is a lot to do and not much time.

 * I'm not sure where this fits into the proposal -- if it does at all --
   but I think we definitely need some kind of code reviews. This is for
   two reasons. First, I think it's a good opportunity for everyone to
   grow as programmers, and secondly, we need to ensure that any code
   proposed for contribution to ODL is of high quality. These code reviews
   could be between Andi and the students, or simply amongst the students
   themselves.
