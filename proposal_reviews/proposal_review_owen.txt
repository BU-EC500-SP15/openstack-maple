I add some sentences into the introduction of the OpenDaylight. I didn't know the logic behind those big companies' very positive attitude  to an open source project. However after I have done some search and now I totally understand the reason behind it. Companies get tired of building their own SDN controllers and it is a waste to do it differently. Therefore the importance of OpenDaylight is not restrict into the academaic research area, it will become a world standard and will be accpted by most of the vendors in the world.
